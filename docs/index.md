# Alphasians's Community

Welcome to our handbook - this is where we document how we expect our members to interact within our community.

## About Us

Alphasians is an Open Source community aimed at encouraging and promoting communication, best practices and technical expertise in an inclusive and welcoming environment.

We are a group of individuals who are passionate about the open source software community and the open source software itself. We are a community of developers, designers, testers, and project managers.


## Sub-communities of Alphasians are:

- [CNCF NOIDA](https://community.cncf.io/noida/)
    A group for people interested in talking about and hacking on Distributed Systems including Kubernetes, CNCF, Scheduling and orchestrating containers at scale, ....
    We’re excited about Microservices, Containers, the distributions that run them and the solutions that deploy, manage, and extend them and share experiences around Kubernetes and other CNCF projects such as Prometheus, Linkerd, OpenTracing, FluentD etc.

- [GHW - Alphasians' Guild](https://discord.mlh.io/)
    There’s strength in numbers, so here are some pre-made marketing templates. Completing a journey is always more fun with friends, so share your guild with anyone you want to go on an adventure with - classmates, friends, family, and more! The more members your guild has, the more experience you'll earn.
