# Developer Guide

As a member of the development team, you may be assigned issues and tasks that are essential to the maintenance of and improvement on our projects. We greatly appreciate your dedication to our work, and we have the highest respect for you volunteering your time. Tasks that are assigned, however, will need to be completed in a timely manner.

If you find that you are unable to complete a task quickly, that's okay! We ask that you communicate with the rest of the development team in our chat so someone can assist you in getting the issue resolved. Our number one goal is to ensure we are not preventing updates from rolling out to our users.

## Secrets

In the course of your work, you may require access to project secrets such as API tokens or deployment instances. Any project secrets are shared on a very strict need-to-know basis, and the disclosure of secrets to unauthorised parties may result in removal of your permissions and/or legal action. We trust you, but are obligated to keep our projects secure as well.

## GitHub

Moderating GitHub involves triaging issues and reviewing pull requests, as well as fostering communication between our contributors and enforcing our community guidelines.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

Reviewing a pull request does require some understanding of the code base for that particular project. However, we are a community of learning, so if you would like some assistance reviewing a PR let another mod know! Someone will help you understand the changes.

The first step is to review the changes made to the code or files using GitHub's UI. You should make sure the changes are logical, add value, and do not add any spam or malicious content.

Then, using whichever method you prefer, pull the changes down locally (or use an environment like GitPod) and test the changes. Make sure the changes resolve the linked issue or implement the feature/fix as expected.

If you are happy with the changes made in the PR, add your review comments and select "Approve". If you would like to see changes, use the GitHub Suggestion feature where possible to create committable changes for the contributor to apply. When not possible, be as clear and descriptive as possible to make the process smoother for the contributor.

If you have any questions about this process, ask your fellow moderators.

### Write Access

If you think you need maintainer access on one of our projects to perform your work, let Admins know and we can discuss it further.
